# Spec Changelog

All changes to specifications are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **004-notification-system**: Discord messages now trigger the orchestrator — human replies from Discord room channels and ASK_HUMAN threads call `HandleHumanMessage(roomId)` to wake up agents. Previously, Discord messages were stored but agents never responded because the orchestrator was not notified.
- **005-workspace-runtime**: Default room ordering — `GetRoomsAsync` now sorts the configured default room first, then remaining rooms alphabetically by name.

### Added
- **004-notification-system**: Discord room-based channel routing — each Agent Academy room gets a dedicated Discord channel under an "Agent Academy" category. Webhook-based message formatting: each agent appears as a distinct Discord sender with custom name and avatar (via DiceBear Identicons). Bidirectional bridging: human replies in room channels route back to the correct AA room via `PostHumanMessageAsync`. Channels and webhooks created lazily on first message, mappings rebuilt on restart from channel topics. Error/system messages use compact embeds; regular messages are clean plain text.
- **004-notification-system**: ASK_HUMAN error propagation fix — `NotificationManager.SendAgentQuestionAsync` now returns `(bool Sent, string? Error)` tuple instead of bare bool. Actual exception details (e.g., "Missing Permissions") surfaced to the agent instead of misleading "no provider connected" message.

### Added
- **007-agent-commands**: Implemented Phase 1B state management commands — CLAIM_TASK (with auto-activation from Queued), RELEASE_TASK (ownership validation), UPDATE_TASK (status/blocker/note with allowed-status guard), APPROVE_TASK (reviewable-state validation, reviewer recording, ReviewRounds increment), REQUEST_CHANGES (with required findings, review message posting), SHOW_REVIEW_QUEUE (InReview/AwaitingValidation filter). 5 new ActivityEventType values (TaskClaimed, TaskReleased, TaskApproved, TaskChangesRequested, TaskStatusUpdated). 6 new WorkspaceRuntime methods + PostTaskNoteAsync helper. 28 new tests.

### Added
- **007-agent-commands**: Implemented ASK_HUMAN command — Discord agent-to-human question bridge. Category-per-workspace, channel-per-agent, thread-per-question Discord architecture. Persistent `MessageReceived` handler routes human replies back to agent's room via `WorkspaceRuntime.PostHumanMessageAsync`. Non-blocking: handler returns immediately, reply arrives asynchronously. `INotificationProvider` extended with `SendAgentQuestionAsync` default method. All agents have `ASK_HUMAN` permission and startup prompt documentation. 11 new tests.
- **004-notification-system**: Activity event bridge — `ActivityNotificationBroadcaster` hosted service forwards 7 event types (MessagePosted, TaskCreated, errors, commands) from `ActivityBroadcaster` to `NotificationManager`. Config persistence in `notification_configs` table with atomic upsert. Non-blocking auto-restore on startup. Settings tab in frontend with inline wizard mode. 35 new tests (commit `691ec89`).

### Changed
- **007-agent-commands**: Reconciled frontend surface contradiction — Phase 1A shipped backend-only with no UI surfaces. Command execution is invisible to users; results appear as system messages in conversation history. Updated "Frontend Surfaces" section to reflect NOT IMPLEMENTED status with planned work. Documented all 9 live commands (5 Phase 1A + 4 memory) with implementation evidence (handler files, commit `63b596c`). Updated Known Gaps to remove resolved items and add backend-only reality. Changed "Implementation Note" from factual to aspirational "Design Principle (Not Yet Applied)".

### Added
- **007-agent-commands**: Implemented Phase 1A — command envelope, parser, pipeline, authorization (default-deny with wildcard patterns), audit trail. Read handlers: LIST_ROOMS, LIST_AGENTS, LIST_TASKS, READ_FILE, SEARCH_CODE. Pipeline runs in parallel with existing free-text parsing.
- **008-agent-memory**: Implemented — REMEMBER (upsert), RECALL (LIKE search), LIST_MEMORIES, FORGET. No memory cap. Memories persisted in `agent_memories` table, injected into agent prompts as `=== YOUR MEMORIES ===` section.
- **007-agent-commands**: Agent permissions co-located in `agents.json` — each agent has `Permissions` property with `Allowed`/`Denied` arrays supporting wildcard patterns (e.g., `LIST_*`).
- **007-agent-commands**: Command audit trail — every command execution recorded in `command_audits` table with correlation ID, agent, command, args, status, result, and timestamp.
- **007-agent-commands**: Agent Command System spec — unified command pipeline with envelope, authorization, audit trails. 80+ commands across 3 tiers. Covers formalized reads, task state management, verification, DMs, navigation, room management, agent self-modification. Safety constraints and permission model per agent role.
- **008-agent-memory**: Agent Memory System spec — persistent per-agent knowledge store with REMEMBER/RECALL/FORGET commands. 14 categories by role. Isolated per agent, injected into prompts.

### Fixed
- **003-agent-system**: CopilotExecutor now passes `OnPermissionRequest = PermissionHandler.ApproveAll` to `SessionConfig` (required by SDK v0.2.0) — fixes sessions failing to create and silently falling back to stubs
- **003-agent-system**: CopilotExecutor now accepts `IConfiguration` and reads `Copilot:GitHubToken` for token-based authentication
- **003-agent-system**: StubExecutor replaced canned role-based responses with a clear offline notice — users can now distinguish stub output from real agent responses
- **003-agent-system**: Documented `Copilot:CliPath` configuration — system CLI (with existing auth) must be used instead of SDK's bundled binary (which has no auth state)
- **005-workspace-runtime**: Room participants now reflect actual agent locations (`AgentLocationEntity`) instead of role-based heuristic — fixes agents appearing in wrong rooms
- **005-workspace-runtime**: Added index on `agent_locations.RoomId`; `GetRoomsAsync` pre-loads all locations to avoid N+1 queries
- **006-orchestrator**: Multi-round conversation loop — `RunConversationRoundAsync` now loops up to 3 rounds per trigger when non-PASS responses are produced in rooms with active tasks, preventing single-round stalls
- **005-workspace-runtime**: Agent room placement — `CreateTaskAsync` auto-joins `AutoJoinDefaultRoom` agents into new task rooms (skips Working agents, best-effort error handling)
- **300-frontend-ui**: Room card agent list now starts at the left edge below the badge, spanning the full card width

### Added
- **003-agent-system (Auth → SDK)**: Automatic Copilot SDK activation on GitHub OAuth login
  - `CopilotTokenProvider` singleton: captures OAuth access token during login, clears on logout
  - `CopilotExecutor` token resolution chain: user OAuth → config token → env/CLI → stub
  - Token-change-aware client lifecycle: old CopilotClient disposed + sessions cleared when token changes
  - `AuthController.Logout` clears stored token
- **003-agent-system (SSE)**: SSE activity stream as alternative to SignalR
  - `GET /api/activity/stream` endpoint with replay, bounded channel, nginx-safe headers
  - `useActivitySSE.ts` client hook with auto-reconnect and `enabled` param
  - Transport selection via `localStorage` key `aa-transport` (`"signalr"` default, `"sse"` alternative)
  - `useActivityHub.ts` updated with `enabled` param for conditional activation
- **300-frontend-ui (SignalR)**: Real-time activity event streaming via `@microsoft/signalr`
  - `useActivityHub.ts` hook: connects to `/hubs/activity` with auto-reconnect + initial retry
  - `useWorkspace.ts`: handles AgentThinking/AgentFinished (per-room thinking state), triggers refresh on MessagePosted/RoomCreated/TaskCreated/PhaseChanged/PresenceUpdated
  - Polling reduced from 30s to 120s (fallback only)
  - ChatPanel status bar shows live connection state (connected/connecting/reconnecting/disconnected)

### Changed
- **300-frontend-ui (Sidebar)**: Agents now shown inside room cards instead of separate roster box
  - Each room card displays agents located in that room via `agentLocations` data
  - Thinking agents get a spinning ring animation around their status dot
  - Thinking state tracked per-room so spinners work across all room cards
  - Room list always visible (was hidden with only 1 room)

### Added
- **010-task-management (Phases 1-3)**: Task model extension, API endpoints, and frontend task list
  - Phase 1: Fixed auto-spec task creation on onboard when `!hasSpecs`
  - Phase 2: Extended TaskSnapshot/TaskEntity with 15 new fields; TaskSize, PullRequestStatus enums; AgentGitIdentity; EF migration; 7 API endpoints; InProgressStatuses for room queries
  - Phase 3: TaskListPanel component with status grouping, collapsible completed, URL-safe PR links

### Added
- **GitHub OAuth**: GitHub App OAuth login with cookie-based sessions
  - Server: opt-in auth pipeline (AddAuthentication + AddCookie + AddOAuth), FallbackPolicy, AuthController
  - Client: LoginPage, UserBadge (top-right avatar + sign out), auth gating in App.tsx
  - Security: open redirect prevention, minimal scopes (read:user + user:email), no token in cookie
  - Startup resilience: auth status check retries on 502
